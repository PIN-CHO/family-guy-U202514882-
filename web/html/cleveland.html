            <p class="profile-bio">Cleveland Brown is a recurring character in the animated television series Family Guy. He is the Griffins' mild-mannered and soft-spoken neighbor, known for his distinctive voice and catchphrase "Oh, that's nasty!" Cleveland is characterized by his calm demeanor, friendly nature, and occasional involvement in humorous situations. He is also the protagonist of the spin-off series The Cleveland Show, which explores his life after moving to Virginia with his new family. Throughout Family Guy, Cleveland's character provides a contrast to the more outrageous personalities of the other main characters, often serving as a voice of reason amidst the chaos.</p>
